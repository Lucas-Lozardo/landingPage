    "title": "Backend Developer | Java & Spring Boot",
    "description": "I am a backend developer with 3 years of experience in Java. I focus on creating RESTful APIs using the Spring Boot framework, with data persistence in relational databases like PostgreSQL and H2 DataBase. I am familiar with good development practices such as SOLID principles, automated testing with JUnit, and code versioning with Git. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge beyond backend by studying HTML and CSS to better understand how the presentation layer works and how it communicates with the APIs I develop. This journey is helping me build complete projects, even if simple, and improve my overall web development vision.",
